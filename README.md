This is a personal project that I'm developing in order to improve my code skills. I have choosen to develop 'poshan' because I love fitness life and healthy food.

## About

The project is a SPAs developed with React where you can find a landing page with all the main information about the project, a contact page where you can submit a form made with 'formspree' and a questionnaire. On the questionnaire you can answer some questions about you and your habits and a personalized plan will be calculated for you!

\*\* The project is still in progress, I hope I can have an mvp soon!
